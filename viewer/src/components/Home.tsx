    <h3>On Definitions</h3>
    <Tex>
      We have broken with Counterexamples in a few notable places, mostly to
      update things like the separation axioms to their more modern useage
      (where $T_i$ ‚áí $T_j$ whenever $i > j$). Our definitions should
      match those given in e.g.
      {' '}<a href="http://www.amazon.com/General-Topology-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486434796">
